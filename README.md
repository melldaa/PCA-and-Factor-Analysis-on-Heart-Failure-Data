# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis on Heart Failure Clinical Dataset


---

## 📊 Overview

The project applies PCA and factor analysis to uncover latent structures and reduce dimensionality in biomedical data. The dataset consists of medical variables related to heart failure patients.

### Main Techniques Used:
- Pearson correlation matrix visualization
- Bartlett’s test of sphericity
- Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Factor Analysis via principal axis factoring
- Scree plot for component selection
- Communality analysis
- Residual correlation diagnostics
